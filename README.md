# SVM-Algorithm-optimization-using-SMO

SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used mostly for classifications. Training of the SVM algorithm is slow for large datasets and its complex to implement. SMO (Sequential minimal optimization) is faster by about 1000 times. The project used SMO method to produce output on a given dataset and measured the computation time.
